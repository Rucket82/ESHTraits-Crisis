This repository is a collection of various code changes that I've made to AresMUSH for the Crisis Point MUSH, and maybe other places.  Who can say!
# web portal snippets
* admins.hbs - On the game I am doing some administrative work on, I was a little annoyed that the 'admins' page of the website would have icons in different vertical positions due to the text in the 'admin/position' field.  I simply made them align.

# plugins-profile
A few small updates to the profile code for AresMUSH based on my own personal preferences.

# plugins-eshtraits
