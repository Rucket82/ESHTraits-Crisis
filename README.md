All the code that gets thrown into this repository is code that I've done for the Crisis Point MUSH, which uses the AresMUSH platform.  Detailed below are some of those changes in case you might be interested in picking up any of the files for yourself:

# web portal snippets
* admins.hbs -- On the game I am doing some administrative work on, I was a little annoyed that the 'admins' page of the website would have icons in different vertical positions due to the text in the 'admin/position' field.  I simply made them align.
* profile-supplemental.hbs & profile-system.hbs -- I made changes to these two templates within app/templates/components because the number of tabs under System Information was getting a little too long for my liking, and I felt that the profile could be slightly better organized on the web-side of things.

# plugins-profile
One small update to the profile code for AresMUSH that makes the template output onto the game slightly cleaner, at least to my own personal preferences.

# plugins-eshtraits
ESH Traits Plugin for Ares -- This code is a few changes made to the great work done by Clockwork based on the needs of Crisis Point.  You can find more information on the core plugin here (which I highly recommend for comic-themed games) -- https://github.com/ClockworkEJD/plugins-eshtraits
